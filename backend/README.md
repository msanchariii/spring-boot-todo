## Configure the Application

### 1. Database Configuration:
    
Open the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file and add the following configuration for the H2 in-memory database:

```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/todo_db
spring.datasource.username=yourUsername
spring.datasource.password=yourPassword
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
```


1. Use Proper Layered Architecture
   Separation of Concerns: Divide your application into clear layers: Controller (for handling HTTP requests), Service (for business logic), Repository (for data access), and Model (for entity representation). This promotes maintainability and testability.
   Avoid Business Logic in Controllers: The controller should focus solely on handling requests and responses, not the business logic. All business logic should reside in the service layer.
2. Exception Handling
   Global Exception Handling: Use @ControllerAdvice or @ExceptionHandler to handle exceptions globally or locally. This ensures consistent error responses and cleaner code in controllers.
   Custom Exceptions: Define your custom exception classes for specific error cases, and map them to meaningful HTTP responses.
3. Use Dependency Injection Properly
   Autowiring: Use @Autowired or constructor injection (preferred) to inject dependencies. Constructor injection makes it clear which dependencies are required for a class and is easier to test.
   Loose Coupling: Avoid tight coupling between components. Spring's IoC (Inversion of Control) helps by managing dependencies, making it easier to swap components without affecting other parts of the application.
4. Configuration Management
   Externalize Configuration: Use application.properties or application.yml files to store configuration properties. Consider using Spring’s @Value or @ConfigurationProperties to inject configuration values into your beans.
   Profiles: Use Spring profiles (application-dev.properties, application-prod.properties) to configure different settings for various environments.
5. Database Access
   JPA Repositories: Use Spring Data JPA to simplify database access with repository interfaces. It reduces boilerplate code and promotes best practices like query derivation and pagination.
   Avoid N+1 Query Problem: Use @ManyToOne, @OneToMany, @ManyToMany relationships cautiously. Leverage @EntityGraph or JOIN FETCH in JPQL queries to prevent inefficient queries.
   Transactional Boundaries: Mark service methods with @Transactional to ensure that operations are atomic and consistent.
6. Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)
   Separation of Layers: Use DTOs to decouple your internal model (entity) from the API response. This ensures that the API only exposes the necessary data and hides internal details.
   Avoid Over-fetching Data: Only expose the required data in the API responses, especially when working with sensitive information like passwords, user roles, etc.
7. API Design
   RESTful Principles: Follow REST principles like statelessness, proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and appropriate status codes. Organize endpoints in a logical way (e.g., /api/users, /api/orders).
   Versioning: Use API versioning to ensure backward compatibility. You can version APIs by using the URL path (/api/v1/users) or headers (X-API-Version).
   Use Proper HTTP Status Codes: Return correct HTTP status codes to indicate success (200), creation (201), client errors (400), and server errors (500).
8. Security Best Practices
   Authentication & Authorization: Use Spring Security for user authentication and authorization. Prefer JWT tokens for stateless authentication in REST APIs.
   Avoid Hardcoded Credentials: Never hardcode sensitive information like passwords or API keys in the code. Use environment variables or external configuration management.
   Use HTTPS: Always use HTTPS in production to ensure that the communication is secure.
   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) & SQL Injection: Use proper input validation and prepared statements to prevent XSS and SQL injection attacks.
9. Testing
   Unit Testing: Write unit tests for individual components using JUnit and Mockito. Test services, controllers, and repositories in isolation.
   Integration Testing: Use @SpringBootTest for integration tests to validate end-to-end functionality with the actual Spring context.
   Test Coverage: Aim for high test coverage and include edge cases, error handling, and performance tests.
   Mocking External Services: Use tools like MockMvc for simulating HTTP requests and responses in controller tests.
10. Logging
    Centralized Logging: Use Spring Boot’s logging configuration (logback, log4j2) for application logging. Ensure logs are well-structured, with appropriate log levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR) and useful information like timestamps and request IDs.
    External Log Aggregation: In production, aggregate logs to tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or centralized log management platforms to monitor the system.
11. Asynchronous Processing
    @Async Annotation: Use Spring’s @Async to handle long-running tasks asynchronously. This can improve performance by freeing up threads for other tasks.
    Task Executors: Configure task executors to control the number of threads and improve the management of asynchronous tasks.
12. Use Caching
    Improve Performance: Use Spring Cache abstraction (@Cacheable, @CachePut, @CacheEvict) to cache frequently accessed data and reduce database load.
    Distributed Caching: For larger applications, use distributed caches like Redis or Memcached to share cache across multiple instances.
13. API Documentation
    Swagger/OpenAPI: Use tools like Swagger or Springfox to automatically generate API documentation. This helps teams understand and test the API quickly.
    Document Endpoints Properly: Make sure to document the purpose of each API, expected inputs/outputs, and status codes.
14. Monitoring and Metrics
    Actuator: Leverage Spring Boot Actuator to expose application health, metrics, and environment information. This helps with monitoring and troubleshooting in production.
    Custom Metrics: For more advanced use cases, define custom metrics for your application using Micrometer (Spring Boot’s metric collection library) to track specific business processes.
15. Code Quality
    Consistency: Maintain consistent code style (e.g., indentation, naming conventions) across the team. Use tools like Checkstyle or SonarQube to enforce coding standards.
    Refactor and DRY: Always refactor code to remove duplication and keep it modular and clean.
    Use Builder Pattern: For complex objects, use the builder pattern to ensure immutability and avoid construction errors.
16. Performance Optimization
    Database Indexing: Ensure proper database indexing to improve the speed of frequent queries.
    Profile Queries: Use Hibernate’s query performance logging to detect slow queries and optimize them.
    Connection Pooling: Use connection pooling libraries like HikariCP to efficiently manage database connections.
    Avoid Memory Leaks: Monitor application memory usage and ensure proper resource management (e.g., closing database connections).
